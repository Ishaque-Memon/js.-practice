"use strict";  //Treat all Js code as newer version. 
//Note: With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.

//accountId = 2 just like this is undeclared variable

//var accountId = 2 This is correct way to declare an variable
//console.log(accountId);

// alert(3+3) Note: we are using nodejs, not browser
